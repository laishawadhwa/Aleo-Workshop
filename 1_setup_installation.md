# Setting up the environment for development on Aleo Netwrok

## Setup for Linux and MacOS

## Check prerequisites
```
git --version
cargo --version
```

## Install Git and Rust

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Note: After installation, if your `git` and `rustc` command doesn't work, try to close the current terminal window, open a new one, and try again.

## Install leo

Clone the `leo` repository

```bash
# Download the source code
git clone https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo
cd leo
```

Build and install `leo` CLI

```bash
# Build and install
cargo install --path .
```

That will generate the executable ~/.cargo/bin/leo.

Now to use Leo, in your terminal, run:

    leo
For more details about how to use `leo` Cli, check out [this link](https://developer.aleo.org/leo/commands)

## Install snarkOS - LINUX & MACOS

Clone the `snarkOS` repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkOS.git --depth 1
cd snarkOS

# Switch to the testnet3 branch
git checkout testnet3
```

[For Ubuntu users] A helper script to install dependencies is available. From the snarkOS directory, run:

```bash
./build_ubuntu.sh
```

Lastly, install snarkOS:

```
cargo install --path .
```

Please ensure ports 4133/tcp and 3033/tcp are open on your router and OS firewall.

For more details about how to use `snarkOS` CLI, check out [this link](https://developer.aleo.org/testnet/getting_started/installation/#22-installation).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues with snarkOS

- Compiling Woes: Ensure Rust v1.66+ is installed and use ./run-client.sh or ./run-prover.sh to initiate snarkOS.
- Connectivity Issues: Check if ports 4133/tcp and 3033/tcp are open. Also, ensure youâ€™ve used the right commands to start snarkOS.
- Address Generation Issues: Execute source ~/.bashrc before the snarkos account new command. Check your spelling; the directory is /snarkOS, but the command is snarkos.

## Install `leo` IDE Syntax Highlighting:

## Docker pull leo

This is the development environment docker of aleo blockchain with leo, rust, and git installed.

pull docker image

```
docker pull 0xaragondocker/leo_docker:latest
```

run docker

```
docker run -it 0xaragondocker/leo_docker /bin/bash
```

## Windows Installation for Rust 

### Rust Installation
Rust runs on many platforms, and there are many ways to install Rust. This guide describes installation via rustup, a tool that manages multiple Rust toolchains in a consistent way across all platforms Rust supports. 
- On Windows, download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe)
- rustup-init can be configured interactively, and all options can additionally be controlled by command-line arguments, which can be passed through the shell script. Pass --help to rustup-init as follows to display the arguments rustup-init accepts:
```
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- --help
```
- The above command needs to executed using WSL
- If you prefer not to use the shell script, you may directly download rustup-init for windows [here](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe)
- verify rust installation by runnin ```rustc --version``` in wsl
